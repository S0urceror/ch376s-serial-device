# CH376s-Serial-Device mode
Created an application to turn the CH376s into a serial device.  
  
This compiles into a MacOS, Teensy and MSX target.  
The latter contains also a full implementation of a ROM based terminal and monitor application.  
  
Will probably move into the MSXUSB repository soon.
